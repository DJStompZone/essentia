        "To follow this tutorial (and [various Python examples we provide](https://essentia.upf.edu/python_examples.html)) interactively, we provide [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) Python notebooks. They are located in the `src/examples/python` folder [in the source code](https://github.com/MTG/essentia/tree/master/src/examples/python). The notebook for this tutorial is `essentia_python_tutorial.ipynb` ([link](https://github.com/MTG/essentia/blob/master/src/examples/python/essentia_python_tutorial.ipynb)). If you are not familiar with Python notebooks, read how to use them [here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io).\n",

        "You should have the [NumPy](http://numpy.scipy.org/) package installed for computations with vectors and matrices in Python and [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/) for plotting. Other recommended packages for scientific computing not used in this tutorial but often used with Essentia are [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/), [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [seaborn](https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/) for visualization.\n",

        "\n",
        "The big strength of Essentia is its extensive collection of optimized and tested algorithms for audio processing and analysis, all conveniently available within the same library. You can parametrize and re-use these algorithms for specific use-cases and your custom analysis pipelines. For more details on the algorithms, see the [algorithms overview](https://essentia.upf.edu/algorithms_overview.html) and the complete [algorithms reference](https://essentia.upf.edu/algorithms_reference.html)."

That means that in standard mode, you tell exactly the computer what to do, whereas in the streaming mode, you \"declare\"  what is needed to be done, and you let the computer do it itself. One big advantage of the streaming mode is that the memory consumption is greatly reduced, as you don't need to load the entire audio in memory. Also, streaming mode allows reducing the amount of code which may be very significant for larger projects. Let's have a look at it.\n",
